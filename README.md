## Library manager with Express, Jade and Sequelize
*Project 10 of Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript course*

### To run this project:
Run `git clone https://github.com/jprittie/Library-manager-with-Express-and-Sequelize.git` to clone the project on your local machine. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Run `npm start` to start the project with the node server. Navigate to localhost:3000.


### Project objectives:
This project creates a library management system for a small library. The librarian has been using a simple sqlite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to handle the library's books, patrons and loans.


### Specific requirements:
* Given static HTML designs and the existing SQLite database, students must implement a dynamic website in Express and a SQL ORM, Sequelize.
* Create Sequelize models for books, patrons and loans tables according to strict requirements.
* Templates include a home screen and pages for overall books, patrons and loans listings. There are also detailed screens for each of these categories.


The librarian should be able to:
* Filter books by overdue and checked out books to quickly see the state of the library.
* Add a book or patron to the database, as well as check out and return books.
* Go to a bookâ€™s detail page, make edits and view its loan history. 
* Go to a patron's detail page, make edits and view their loan history.
* Be notified if any of the required fields in any given form have any missing data, so that the information can be corrected.
